    <h4>Shared Meal is a place to connect with others, break bread and share a meal.</h4>
    <p>If you're out dining on your own, why not post a meal? A fellow user can see who'll be dining in their area and join you.</p>
    <p>What connections or conversations can be built over the time of one meal? That's up to you. This is more about community and less about commitment.</p>
    <p>Share the empty seats at your table, be nice and split the bill (or ask for separate tabs).</p>
