## Welcome to Shared Meal

[Shared Meal](http://murmuring-mesa-7178.herokuapp.com) is a place to connect with others, break bread and share a meal.

If you're out dining on your own, why not post a meal? A fellow user can see who'll be dining in their area and join you.

What connections or conversations can be built over the time of one meal? That's up to you. This is more about community and less about commitment.

Share the empty seats at your table, be nice and split the bill (or ask for separate tabs).
